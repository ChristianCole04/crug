Yea, she does that with her real life too. I dunno how she does it and frankly it's a little scary but I cannot respect her enough for it. Incredibly iconic- taught me how to curtsy and color theory, your teachings will not be forgotten."

With a skip in her step and one of the most beautiful laughs i have ever heard, Teaghan will brighten any day. She sparks the most wonderful of conversations and can be located by a beaming smile. Along with this sweetness, she isn’t afraid to hilariously call people big headed or hoes. She looks out for her friends and is open to those she trusts. She is kind, talented, and very very strong. truly, you will never know anyone like her.”

I know I can count on her to immidiately shoot down stupid ideas I have when needed, but also to help grow them like a horrific man-eating-plant. Probably one of the funniest people I've met- ever single time it feels like a galvanic shock when she calls someone a 'hoe' or 'bigheaded' and I would never dream of changing that nature of her humor. War-hardnened and courageous, Teaghan is the penultimate, the almightly."
